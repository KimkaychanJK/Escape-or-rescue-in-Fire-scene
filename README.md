As we knowï¼Œthe fire is ruthless and many people died in the fire including firefighters. So when the fire broke out,it is necessary for us to know the safe escape path in the first place rather than running blindly out especially in areas with complex terrain.And for firefighters, it is also important to find the best path to fight the fire, at least to ensure their own safety.
